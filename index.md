<!-- ## About Me -->
<a id="about-me"></a>

I am a Machine Learning Researcher in the Foundation Models team at Apple Inc. in New York City, NY.

Previously, I was a research engineer at [Facebook AI Research](https://ai.facebook.com/) (Meta AI/FAIR), working on AI for Creativity, specifically in human motion modeling and generative modeling for character animation. Previously at Meta AI, I was in the Language and Translation Technologies team, where I co-developed and deployed Neural Machine Translation models for the Facebook family of apps, supporting over 7 billion translations per day.

In the past, I've worked as a software engineer at LinkedIn, and as an intern at Facebook AI, Microsoft Research, and Amazon.

I obtained a master's degree from Language Technologies Institute, Carnegie Mellon University, where I worked on Multimodal ML with Prof. LP Morency at the [MultiComp Lab](http://multicomp.cs.cmu.edu/), and a bachelor's degree from BITS Pilani, India.

More details about my work experience are in [my CV](DeepakGopinath_CV.pdf). A full list of my publications can be found [here](#publications) and on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=-ZCV1BsAAAAJ).
